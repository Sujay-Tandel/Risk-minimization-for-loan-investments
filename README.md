# Risk-minimization-for-loan-investments

Nowadays one can invest in the loans of other people using online peer-to-peer lending platforms like, for example, the Lending Club. On the Lending Club borrowers with higher credit scores (more trustworthy and less risky) get lower interest rates for their loans while borrowers with lower credit scores (less trustworthy and more risky) get higher rates. From the point of view of the investor the loans with higher interest rates are more attractive because they provide higher return on investment (ROI) but on the other hand they pose risks of being not returned at all (defaulted). Therefore, the machine learning model that could predict which of the high interest loans are more likely to be returned, would bring added value by minimizing the associated risks.
